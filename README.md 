# Document AI API Test

This project demonstrates how to use Google Cloud's Document AI API to process and extract information from documents. The code authenticates the user, sends a document to the Document AI API for processing, and displays the extracted entities.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Google Cloud account with Document AI API enabled
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/document-ai-api-test.git
    cd document-ai-api-test
    ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Authenticate with Google Cloud:**
    - If running in Google Colab, the code will prompt you to authenticate.
    - If running locally, ensure you have set up your Google Cloud credentials.

## Usage

1. **Update the project ID and processor details in `document_ai_api_test.py`:**
    ```py
    project_id = "your-project-id"
    location = "your-processor-location"
    processor_id = "your-processor-id"
    ```

2. **Run the script:**
    ```sh
    python document_ai_api_test.py
    ```

3. **Process the document:**
    - The script will read a PDF document, encode it in base64, and send it to the Document AI API.
    - The response will be processed and the extracted entities will be displayed.

## Example

The script processes a document and prints the extracted entities:
Document processed successfully! Entity: DATE, Value: 2023-10-01 Entity: AMOUNT, Value: $1000 ...


## Dependencies

- `google-auth-httplib2`
- `google-cloud-documentai`
- `google-cloud-firestore`
- `google-cloud-bigquery`
- `vertexai`
- `requests`
- `sentence-transformers`
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
